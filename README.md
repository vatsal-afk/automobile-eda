# Flight Ticket Price Analysis  

## Overview  
This project explores flight ticket prices using data analysis techniques to identify patterns and factors affecting price variations. The analysis includes examining airlines, departure times, flight durations, number of stops, and other relevant features.  

## Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight ticket prices.  
- Identify key factors influencing price variations.  
- Visualize trends and relationships in the dataset.  

## Data Analysis  
The EDA process involves:  
- Handling missing values and data cleaning.  
- Visualizing distributions and correlations.  
- Understanding how different features impact ticket prices.  

## Features Analyzed  
- **Airline:** The airline operating the flight.  
- **Departure Time:** Scheduled flight departure time.  
- **Duration:** Total flight duration.  
- **Stops:** Number of layovers.  
- **Other Factors:** Additional details that may influence ticket prices.  

## Next Steps  
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing.  
- Model selection and training for price prediction.  
- Evaluation and optimization of the predictive model.
