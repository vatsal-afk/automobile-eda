Flight Ticket Price Prediction ✈️

This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various features like airline, departure time, flight duration, and number of stops. By building a machine learning model, we can estimate flight prices for new bookings based on these factors, making it a practical and useful tool for travel enthusiasts, agencies, and even individuals looking for affordable flight options.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict flight ticket prices based on the following factors:

Airline: The airline company operating the flight.
Departure Time: The scheduled departure time of the flight.
Duration: The total flight duration.
Stops: The number of stops during the flight.
Other Features: Additional columns that could influence the ticket price.
